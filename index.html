## Main research questions:

### 1. How are political ads microtargeted in practice? (Paper I and II)
### 2. What is the effect of being exposed to microtargeted political campaigns? (Paper III)

## Paper I: Going Micro to Go Negative

Research Question: 

What role does microtargeting play for negative campaigning?

---

class: center, middle, inverse

## Negative campaigning

*"going negative"*

---

## Negative campaigning

Negative campaigning is a type of advertising that highlights alleged weaknesses of the competitor.

--

*However:* Negative ads are not just negative ads

According to Brooks &amp; Geer (2012) negative campaigning entails:

+ *civil* negative ads

  + legitimate criticism of the opponent
  
--

+ *uncivil* negative ads 

  + "disrespectful, poisonous and hyperbolic [...]" language that "break norms of conversation [...]" (Otto et al. 2020)


&lt;br&gt;

&gt; Let's take a closer look at incivility as a form of negative advertising

---

## Political Incivility

*Is it good to be bad?*

---

## Political Incivility

Acoording to Mutz (2016) political incivility can:

 + lower trust in government

 + reduce faith in institutions 

 + lessen respect for opposing views

--

**But** it can also: 

+ generate stronger interest in voting &amp; in politics more generally (Herbst 2010)

+ increase the memorability of the topics discussed; also known as *negativity bias* (Sydnor 2019)

---

## Backlash effect

*When attacking your opponent backfires*

--

*or: when it's bad to be bad*

---

## Backlash effect

Negative advertising can backfire because voters feel sympathetic toward candidates under attack (Walter &amp; van der Eijk, 2019).

Meta-analysis confirms a backlash effect in 33 out of 40 studies (Lau et al., 2009)

--

Backlash effect can be dependent on voter (and candidate) characteristics:

 + Backlash towards African-American attack sponsors is greater among white voters (Krupnikov and Piston 2015)

 + Nai &amp; Maier (2020) also demonstrate that with incivil ads:

--

    + people high in conflict avoidance significantly reduce rating of the **attack sponsor**

    + individuals high in psychopathy traits rate the **target more negatively**


---


class: center, middle, inverse

## Microtargeting and Negative ads

*"going micro"*

---


## Microtargeting and Negative ads

Microtargeting may lower the risk of backlash effects because:

+ Negative messages can be targeted towards individuals who are most susceptible to them (Nai &amp; Maier 2020)

  + also means: people likely to dislike negativity can be excluded

--
  
+ Negative campaigning is seen as undesirable and harmful by the public
    + (Mutz and Reeves 2005; Mattes and Redlawsk 2014)

--

+ A smaller range of individuals are affected if there were to be a backlash

*Hypotheses:*

&gt; H1: Microtargeted ads from political campaigns are more negative than ads targeted at more general audiences.

&gt; H2: For outside groups we should not find this microtargeting effect because they are less concerned about reputational hits.

---


## Microtargeting and Negative ads

Literature that have looked at this is scarce but two examples stood out:

+ Fowler et al. (2020) analyze TV and Facebook and find the latter to be more positive

  + Campaigns are more likely to have lists of supporters and they are less targeted with negative ads

  + However: only compares TV ads with Facebook and does not differentiate between levels of targeting
  
--

&lt;br&gt;
  
+ Jain and Wood (2020) analyze Facebook ad library data

  + Computer Science pre-print, does not go in a lot of detail but they do find a positive effect of microtargeting on tone

  + However: measure of microtargeting is just received impressions


---

## Measurement

+ Dependent Variable: Negativity/Incivility
  + Perspective API (Toxicity)
  + Prediction by supervised machine learning model trained on incivil/civil negative &amp; positive ads
      
--
  
+ Independent Variable: Microtargeting

&gt; `Potential Reach` estimates how many people your ad could potentially reach depending on the targeting and ad placement options you select while creating an ad. ~Facebook Ad Library

--

.pull-left[
+ 100 - 1.000 individuals reached
+ 1.001 - 5.000
+ 5.001 - 10.000
+ 10.001 - 50.000
+ 50.001 - 100.000
+ 100.001 - 500.000
+ 500.001 - 1 million
+ +1 million
]

.pull-right[
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  The smaller the reach the more microtargeted is an advertisement.
]

## Paper II: Targeting different voters with different messages

*RQ1: How do political advertisers microtarget political ads online?*

*RQ2: Do political advertisers tailor their messages to certain voter groups and if so, to which degree and with which messages?*

---

## Paper II: Targeting different voters with different messages

Through microtargeting:

+ parties might present themselves as one-issue party to each voter 
+ make different promises to different (groups of) people (Zuiderveen Borgesius et al., 2018).

--

For voters it becomes hard to track what a party actually stands for or what their priorities are. 

--

We can reasonably expect that parties will make use of PMT to tailor the "right" message to the "right" voter. 

For example:

The Biden campaign in the US may target older generations with messages on Trump's failure on the Corona virus response since they are more endangered by the virus.


&lt;!-- A political campaign may disregard people  --&gt;
&lt;!--   + who are not politically involved --&gt;
&lt;!--   + they might ignore people who the campaign thinks cannot be swayed to their side (Turow 2012).  --&gt;

---

## Methods

In order to understand whether different voter groups are targeted with different topics, we can make use of structural topic models (Roberts et al. 2014). 

--


A different approach would be to use supervised machine learning:

1. annotate a sample of ads as a training dataset
2. label ads as attack ads, contrast ads, promotion ads
3. label by topic (economy, immigration, health care, environment, etc.) (Qi et al. 2016).

Need to work on particular hypotheses and what countries I want to consider.

## Paper III: Effects of being exposed to Microtargeted Campaigns

Research Question: 

What are the effects of being exposed to targeted political ads on Facebook during the 2021 German general elections?

---



## Paper III: Effects of being exposed to Microtargeted Campaigns



This research plans to examine the effects of political microtargeting (PMT) on people

Leveraging an experimental design that manipulates the condition whether people see or don't see targeted political ads on Facebook. 

The main aim of this paper would be to find out about the various positive and negative consequences that being exposed to targeted political ads might have. 

---

## Effects of being exposed to Microtargeted Campaigns

Microtargeting could be used for positive goals (Zuiderveen Borgesius et al., 2018):

+ encourage citizens to vote on election day

+ increase other forms of political participation (protesting, debating)

+ increase citizens' political literacy, and help citizens make more educated decisions about voting

--

On the other hand, political parties could misuse political microtargeting to:

+ increase affective polarization

+ facilitate the spread of misinformation 

+ suppress vote likelihood. 


---


## Hypotheses

&gt; H1: Being exposed to microtargeted ads increases political engagement and the likelihood to vote.

&gt; H2: Being exposed to microtargeted ads increases perceived understanding of the positions of political parties that are targeting them.

&gt; H3: People exposed to microtargeted ads feel more aligned with positions of political parties that are targeting them.

&gt; H4: Being exposed to microtargeted ads increases affective polarization.

---


## Research Design 

&lt;img src="images/design.png" width="1025" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The treatment group would be exposed to political ads on Facebook and the control group would not be. 

We let participants complete a "Pre-Survey" roughly one month before the elections.
 
---


## Research Design 

&lt;img src="images/design.png" width="1025" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


After they completed the "Pre-Survey" participants will be randomized into either the treatment or the control condition.  In the treatment condition, participants will be advised to install the "Who Targets me" browser plug-in.

 
---


## Research Design 

&lt;img src="images/design.png" width="1025" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


For the control condition, participants would install an Adblocker that blocks ads on Facebook. 

Finally, we check in one week after the election with a "Post-Survey", where we ask about our target measures (again).
